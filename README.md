# Portfolio

## Description

It is a very basic portfolio to showcase my future work. I plan on updating it as I make new projects in the future that I want to showcase. I also want to update the 
how it looks and add more features in the future to make it more responsive.

## Usage

Anyone is welcome to use this, it's very basic so it should be easy to add to.
